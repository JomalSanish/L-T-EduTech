# üß† Machine Learning Flask API

This project is a Flask-based RESTful API that combines multiple machine learning models to perform:

- **Salary Prediction** using Linear Regression
- **Customer Segmentation** using K-Means Clustering
- **Handwritten Digit Recognition** using a Convolutional Neural Network (trained on the MNIST dataset)

It also provides data visualization in the form of plots encoded as base64 images.

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Linear Regression - Salary Prediction
Predicts an employee‚Äôs salary based on their years of experience using a trained linear regression model.

### 2. K-Means Clustering - Customer Segmentation
Clusters customers based on their annual income and spending score. Each cluster is labeled (e.g., "High Spender", "Frugal Spender", etc.).

### 3. Digit Recognition (MNIST)
Accepts a base64-encoded 28x28 grayscale image and uses a CNN model to predict the handwritten digit.

## üß∞ Models Used

### 1. **Linear Regression Model**
- Trained on `Salary_Data.csv`
- Predicts salary from years of experience

### 2. **KMeans Clustering**
- Trained on `Mall_Customers.csv`
- Identifies 5 distinct customer segments

### 3. **CNN for Digit Recognition**
- Trained on the MNIST dataset
- Architecture: Flatten ‚Üí Dense(128, ReLU) ‚Üí Dense(64, ReLU) ‚Üí Dense(10, Softmax)
